Mayonnaise recipe

-1 large egg at room temperature
-1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
-1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar
-1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste
-1 cup neutral flavored oil, grapeseed, safflower or canola is our go-to
-1 teaspoon lemon juice, optional

1-Prepare Mayonnaise:. Add egg, mustard, vinegar and salt to the bowl of a food processor and process for 20 seconds Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, turn the food processor on then begin to add the oil in tiny drops until about 1 / 4 of the oil has been added. It's at this point that you should notice the mixture is beginning to thicken and emulsion. Once this happens, you can be a little less strict with how slowly the oil is added. Continue to add the remaining oil in a very thin stream.

2-Once all of the oil has been added, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl and process for an extra 10 seconds.

3-Taste mayonnaise for seasoning then add salt, lemon juice or extra vinegar to taste.
Storing Homemade Mayonnaise: Store covered in the refrigerator as long as the expiration date of your eggs allow.
